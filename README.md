# 💹 Nexus Track – Professional Expense & Financial Management

**Nexus Track** is a scalable, production-ready financial management application built using **Flutter (Dart 3.x)**.  
It enables users to track expenses, manage budgets, monitor subscriptions, and split shared expenses—all within a modern **cyber-dark fintech UI**.

The project follows a **layered architecture** that cleanly separates UI, business logic, and data models, making it easy to maintain, test, and extend.

---

## 🎯 Project Vision

Nexus Track is designed to:

- 📊 Provide **complete financial visibility**
- ⚡ Deliver a **fast, intuitive user experience**
- 🔐 Enforce **secure authentication & session handling**
- 🧩 Maintain a **modular, scalable architecture**
- 🎨 Offer a **modern fintech-grade UI**

---

## 📱 Application Overview

The app consists of two primary modules:

1. **Authentication Module**
2. **Dashboard Module (Main Application Hub)**

---

## 🔐 Authentication Module

**Location:** `lib/pages/auth/`

Handles user identity and access control.

### 🔑 Login (`login_page.dart`)
- Email & password authentication
- Password visibility toggle
- Forgot password flow hook
- Navigation to sign-up
- Validation-ready form structure

### 📝 Sign Up (`signup_page.dart`)
- Email, password, confirm password fields
- Real-time validation support
- Password masking by default
- Consistent UX with login screen

> 🔒 Authentication logic is abstracted into the service layer for security and maintainability.

---

## 🧭 Dashboard Module

**Location:** `lib/pages/dashboard/`

This is the core of the application after login.

### 🧱 Dashboard Scaffold (`dashboard_page.dart`)
- Persistent **TabBar navigation**
- Central **Floating Action Button (FAB)**
- Global logout action
- Smooth tab switching (no page reloads)

---

## 📑 Dashboard Tabs

Each tab represents a dedicated financial domain.

### 📑 Transactions (`transaction_tab.dart`)
- Core income & expense ledger
- Chronological transaction history
- Empty state for first-time users
- Designed for future filtering & analytics

---

### 📊 Budgeting (`budget_tab.dart`)
- Monthly or category-based budgets
- Tracks spending vs limits
- Ready for progress indicators & alerts

---

### 👥 Shared Expenses (`shared_expense_tab.dart`)
